Modern C++ projects and web services are based on the powerful frameworks and libraries. 
Most of them are efficient and easy-to-use, and there is no need in an another "cool C++ framework". 
But I would like to implement some of these basic tools by myself for better understanding of "guts" of the modern web frameworks.
So it is a C++ pet project intended for the implementation of the basic web service, tools and environment from scratch (or almost from scratch).
